> What is the difference between HTML and CSS?

HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices

> For accessibility in HTML, what is the attribute used to describe an image (on screen readers or if it fails to load)?

`alt` attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

> What is the difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox?

For me, an absolute beginner on web development, I would say the most significant difference is that Flexbox is one dimensional layout while Grid is two dimensional. This [link](https://css-tricks.com/quick-whats-the-difference-between-flexbox-and-grid/) contains more information about the difference. 

> For a responsive website, should it be designed mobile-first or desktop-first?

Mobile-first based on lots of information from Google. I will summarise some ideas from this [post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/taking-the-right-approach-to-responsive-web-design/).
  * Websites are naturally responsive before we even write a single line of CSS.
  * Mobile layouts tend to be very simple, making it very easy to start there. (Desktop-first can lead to redundant code) 

> Describe the components of the CSS Box Model.

This [link](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) is a very good reference for this.
